# React Selectable Dropdown Project

This project demonstrates a customizable React-based selectable dropdown component. It uses functional components, hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`, and provides several configurable properties to tailor dropdown behavior and appearance.

## Features

- **Dynamic Text Width Calculation**: Automatically adjusts the width of the dropdown based on the label of the selected option.
- **Starter Item**: An optional starter item to display within the dropdown selection area before the user makes a selection.
- **Customizable Alignment**: Dropdown options can be aligned to the start or center.
- **Customizable Max Height**: Limit the visible dropdown options with a scrollable view, controlled by the `yLimit` property.
- **Colorful Text Animation**: Supports colorful text animation inside the dropdown using the `colorfultext` prop.
- **Click Outside to Close**: The dropdown closes when the user clicks outside the component.
- **Upward or Downward Dropdown**: Set the dropdown direction with the `direction` prop.
